# About

This repository contains the build and config files for the Washington state Nextstrain two month/four month builds at https://nextstrain.org/groups/waphl. This is a modified version of the [Nextstrain ncov-wa-build](https://github.com/blab/ncov-wa-build).The two month and four month builds are visible at https://nextstrain.org/groups/waphl/ncov/wa/2m and https://nextstrain.org/groups/waphl/ncov/wa/4m respectfully.

The trees are reconstructed using a set of focal sequences (Washington state) during the past two months, four months and global contextual sequences available in GISAID. Contextual sequences included in the tree are chosen by genetic proximity to the focal dataset.
